##JBootValidator (WIP)

IE 8 and 9 make me sad. They don't support either the "required" or "pattern" attributes that help make client side form validation easier.

I'm going to throw this together as a quick fall-back for when I can't let the browser do it's job.

###Todo
 - fix inputs with input-group-addons. They don't look pretty.
 - if a field isn't required, don't apply pattern validation on form submission, just on keyup.
